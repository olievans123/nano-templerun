 * The nano's GL driver reboots the iPod on zero-area triangles (see the Mario Kart port's
 * notes), which a perspective scene produces now and then: far-off detail shrinking to a
 * point, slivers left by near-plane clipping. So, as that port does, vertices are
 * transformed here, triangles are clipped to the near plane and culled (back-facing,
 * off-screen, under about 1/8 pixel), and only the survivors go to GL, as clip-space
 * positions with identity matrices, batched per texture pair. */
